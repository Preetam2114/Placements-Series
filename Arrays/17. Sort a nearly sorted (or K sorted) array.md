### Problem statement: 

    Given an array of n elements, where each element is at most k away from its target position.

### Algorithm:

- **Using Insertion sort:**
    - The inner loop will run at most k times. To move every element to its correct place, at most k elements need to be moved. So overall complexity will be O(nk)

- Using Heap DS:
  -  Create a Min Heap of size k+1 with first k+1 elements. This will take O(k) time
  -  One by one remove min element from heap, put it in result array, and add a new element to heap from remaining elements.
  -  Removing an element and adding a new element to min heap will take Logk time. So overall complexity will be O(k) + O((n-k)*logK)


### Code:

``` cpp

    //Using Insertion Sort
    void insertionSort(int A[], int size){ 
        int i, key, j; 
        for (i = 1; i < size; i++){ 
            key = A[i]; 
            j = i-1; 
            /* Move elements of A[0..i-1], that are greater than key, to one  
                position ahead of their current position. 
                This loop will run at most k times */
            while (j >= 0 && A[j] > key){ 
                A[j+1] = A[j]; 
                j = j-1; 
            } 
            A[j+1] = key; 
        } 
    } 

    //Using Heap Data structure.
    int sortK(int arr[], int n, int k){ 
        // Insert first k+1 items in a priority queue (or min heap) 
        //(A O(k) operation). We assume, k < n. 
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int> > pq(arr, arr + k + 1); 
    
        // i is index for remaining elements in arr[] and index 
        // is target index of for current minimum element in 
        // Min Heapm 'hp'. 
        int index = 0; 
        for (int i = k + 1; i < n; i++) { 
            arr[index++] = pq.top(); 
            pq.pop(); 
            pq.push(arr[i]); 
        } 
    
        while (pq.empty() == false) { 
            arr[index++] = pq.top(); 
            pq.pop(); 
        } 
    }
