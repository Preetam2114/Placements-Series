### Problem statement: 

    Given an array with number with even occurance and a number with odd occurance fins the number with odd occurance
    

### Algorithm:

- The problem can be solved either by using maps but the same can be done using XOR (^)


### Code:

``` cpp

    int getOddOccuranceNumber(int *arr, int size){
        int index, result = 0;
        for(index = 0;index<size;index++){
            result = result^arr[index];
        }
        return result;
    }

```
