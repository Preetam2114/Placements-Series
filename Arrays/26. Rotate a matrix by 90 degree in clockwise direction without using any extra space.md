### Problem statement: 

    Given a square matrix, turn it by 90 degrees in clockwise direction without using any extra space.

### Algorithm:

- **Approach:** 
  - The approach is similar to Inplace rotate square matrix by 90 degrees | Set 1. The only thing that is different is to print the elements of cycle in clockwise direction i.e. An N x N matrix will have floor(N/2) square cycles.
  - For example, a 3 X 3 matrix will have 1 cycle. The cycle is formed by its 1st row, last column, last row, and 1st column.
  - For each square cycle, we swap the elements involved with the corresponding cell in the matrix in the clockwise direction. We just need a temporary variable for this.


### Code:

``` cpp

    // Function to rotate the matrix 90 degree clockwise 
    void rotate90Clockwise(int a[N][N]){ 
        // Traverse each cycle 
        for (int i = 0; i < N / 2; i++) { 
            for (int j = i; j < N - i - 1; j++) { 
    
                // Swap elements of each cycle 
                // in clockwise direction 
                int temp = a[i][j]; 
                a[i][j] = a[N - 1 - j][i]; 
                a[N - 1 - j][i] = a[N - 1 - i][N - 1 - j]; 
                a[N - 1 - i][N - 1 - j] = a[j][N - 1 - i]; 
                a[j][N - 1 - i] = temp; 
            } 
        } 
    } 
    
    // Function for print matrix 
    void printMatrix(int arr[N][N]){ 
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { 
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) 
                cout << arr[i][j] << " "; 
            cout << '\n'; 
        } 
    }

```
