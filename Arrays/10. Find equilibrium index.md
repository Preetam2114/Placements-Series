### Problem statement: 

    Given an array find the point where the sum of left and right half of the array is equal.

### Algorithm:

- **Naive Method:**
  - Use two loops. Outer loop iterates through all the element and inner loop finds out whether the current index picked by the outer loop is equilibrium index or not. Time complexity of this solution is O(n^2).

- **Tricky and Efficient Method:**
  - The idea is to get the total sum of the array first. Then Iterate through the array and keep updating the left sum which is initialized as zero. In the loop, we can get the right sum by subtracting the elements one by one. Thanks to Sambasiva for suggesting this solution and providing code for this.
  - *Algorithm:*
    - Initialize leftsum  as 0
    - Get the total sum of the array as sum
    - Iterate through the array and for each index i, do following.
        - Update sum to get the right sum.<br>
            sum = sum - arr[i] <br>
        // sum is now right sum<br>
        - If leftsum is equal to sum, then return current index. <br>
        // update leftsum for next iteration.<br>
        - leftsum = leftsum + arr[i]
    - return -1 <br>
// If we come out of loop without returning then<br>
// there is no equilibrium index

### Code:

``` cpp

    // Naive method
    int equilibrium(int arr[], int n){ 
        int i, j; 
        int leftsum, rightsum; 
    
        /* Check for indexes one by one until  
        an equilibrium index is found */
        for (i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            /* get left sum */
            leftsum = 0;  
            for (j = 0; j < i; j++) 
                leftsum += arr[j];
            /* get right sum */
            rightsum = 0;  
            for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) 
                rightsum += arr[j];
            /* if leftsum and rightsum   
            are same, then we are done */
            if (leftsum == rightsum) 
                return i; 
        }
        /* return -1 if no equilibrium  
        index is found */
        return -1; 
    } 

    // Tricky and Efficient Method
    int equilibrium(int arr[], int n){  
        int sum = 0; // initialize sum of whole array  
        int leftsum = 0; // initialize leftsum
        /* Find sum of the whole array */
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)  
            sum += arr[i];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){  
            sum -= arr[i]; // sum is now right sum for index i  
            if (leftsum == sum)  
                return i;
            leftsum += arr[i];  
        }
        /* If no equilibrium index found, then return 0 */
        return -1;  
    }
