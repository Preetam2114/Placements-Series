### Problem statement: 

    Given a sorted array (sorted in non-decreasing order) of positive numbers, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of elements of any subset of given set. Expected time complexity is O(n).

### Algorithm:

- A Simple Solution is to start from value 1 and check all values one by one if they can sum to values in the given array.
- We can solve this problem in O(n) time using a simple loop. Let the input array be arr[0..n-1]. 
- We initialize the result as 1 (smallest possible outcome) and traverse the given array. Let the smallest element that cannot be represented by elements at indexes from 0 to (i-1) be ‘res’, there are following two possibilities when we consider element at index i:
  - We decide that ‘res’ is the final result: If arr[i] is greater than ‘res’, then we found the gap which is ‘res’ because the elements after arr[i] are also going to be greater than ‘res’.
  - The value of ‘res’ is incremented after considering arr[i]: The value of ‘res’ is incremented by arr[i] (why? If elements from 0 to (i-1) can represent 1 to ‘res-1’, then elements from 0 to i can represent from 1 to ‘res + arr[i] – 1’ be adding ‘arr[i]’ to all subsets that represent 1 to ‘res’).


### Code:

``` cpp

    int findSmallest(int arr[], int n){ 
        int res = 1; // Initialize result 
        
        // Traverse the array and increment 'res' if arr[i] is 
        // smaller than or equal to 'res'. 
        for (int i = 0; i < n && arr[i] <= res; i++) 
            res = res + arr[i]; 
        
        return res; 
    }

```
