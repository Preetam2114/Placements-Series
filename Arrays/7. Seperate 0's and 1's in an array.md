### Problem statement: 

    You are provided with an array with 0's and 1's you need to seperate 0's and 1's.

### Algorithm:

- **Counting sort:**
  - Count the number of 0s. Let count be C.
  - Once we have count, we can put C 0s at the beginning and 1s at the remaining n â€“ C positions in array.
  
- **Use two indexes to traverse:**
  - Keep incrementing index left while there are 0s at it
  - Keep decrementing index right while there are 1s at it
  - If left < right then exchange arr[left] and arr[right]

- **Another approach:**
  - Take two pointer type0(for element 0) starting from beginning (index = 0) and type1(for element 1) starting from end (index = array.length-1).
  Initialize type0 = 0 and type1 = array.length-1
  - It is intended to Put 1 to the right side of the array. Once it is done, then 0 will definitely towards left side of array.

### Code:

``` cpp
    // Counting sort:
    void segregate0and1(int arr[], int n){ 
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
            if (arr[i] == 0) 
                count++; 
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) 
            arr[i] = 0; 

        for (int i = count; i < n; i++) 
            arr[i] = 1; 
    } 

    // Use two indexes to traverse:
    void twoIndexTraverse(int arr[], int size){
        int left = 0, right = size-1;
        while (left < right){
            while (arr[left] == 0 && left < right)  
                left++;  

            while (arr[right] == 1 && left < right)  
                right--;  

            if (left < right){  
                arr[left] = 0;  
                arr[right] = 1;  
                left++;  
                right--;  
            }  
        }  
    }

    // Final approach:
    void segregate0and1(int arr[],int size){ 
        int type0 = 0; 
        int type1 = size - 1; 
        
        while(type0 < type1){ 
            if(arr[type0] == 1){ 
                swap(arr[type0],  
                    arr[type1]); 
                type1--; 
            } 
            else
            type0++; 
        } 
    }

```
