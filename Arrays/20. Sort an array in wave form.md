### Problem statement: 

    Given an unsorted array of integers, sort the array into a wave like array. An array ‘arr[0..n-1]’ is sorted in wave form if arr[0] >= arr[1] <= arr[2] >= arr[3] <= arr[4] >= …..

### Algorithm:

- **Approach 1:**
  - A Simple Solution is to use sorting. First sort the input array, then swap all adjacent elements.
  - For example, let the input array be {3, 6, 5, 10, 7, 20}. After sorting, we get {3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 20}. After swapping adjacent elements, we get {5, 3, 7, 6, 20, 10}.
  - Below are implementations of this simple approach.

- **Approach 2:**
  - This can be done in O(n) time by doing a single traversal of given array. The idea is based on the fact that if we make sure that all even positioned (at index 0, 2, 4, ..) elements are greater than their adjacent odd elements, we don’t need to worry about odd positioned element. Following are simple steps.
  - Traverse all even positioned elements of input array, and do following.
    - If current element is smaller than previous odd element, swap previous and current.
    - If current element is smaller than next odd element, swap next and current.


### Code:

``` cpp

    // Approach 1 :
    void swap(int *x, int *y){ 
        int temp = *x; 
        *x = *y; 
        *y = temp; 
    } 
  
    // This function sorts arr[0..n-1] in wave form, i.e.,  
    // arr[0] >= arr[1] <= arr[2] >= arr[3] <= arr[4] >= arr[5].. 
    void sortInWave(int arr[], int n){ 
        // Sort the input array 
        sort(arr, arr+n);
        // Swap adjacent elements 
        for (int i=0; i<n-1; i += 2) 
            swap(&arr[i], &arr[i+1]); 
    }

    // Approach 2 :
    void swap(int *x, int *y){ 
        int temp = *x; 
        *x = *y; 
        *y = temp; 
    } 
  
    // This function sorts arr[0..n-1] in wave form, i.e., arr[0] >=  
    // arr[1] <= arr[2] >= arr[3] <= arr[4] >= arr[5] .... 
    void sortInWave(int arr[], int n){ 
        // Traverse all even elements 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i+=2){ 
            // If current even element is smaller than previous 
            if (i>0 && arr[i-1] > arr[i] ) 
                swap(&arr[i], &arr[i-1]); 
    
            // If current even element is smaller than next 
            if (i<n-1 && arr[i] < arr[i+1] ) 
                swap(&arr[i], &arr[i + 1]); 
        } 
    } 
```
