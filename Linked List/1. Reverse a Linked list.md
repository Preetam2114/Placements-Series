### Problem statement: 

    Given pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list. We need to reverse the list by changing links between nodes.

### Algorithm:

- **Iterative Method:**
  - Initialize three pointers prev as NULL, curr as head and next as NULL.
  - Iterate trough the linked list. In loop, do following.
  
        // Before changing next of current,
        // store next node
        next = curr->next
        // Now change next of current
        // This is where actual reversing happens
        curr->next = prev

        // Move prev and curr one step forward
        prev = curr
        curr = next

- **Recursive Method:**
  - Divide the list in two parts - first node and rest of the linked list.
  - Call reverse for the rest of the linked list.
  - Link rest to first.
  - Fix head pointer





### Code:

``` cpp

    // Iterative method
    void reverse(){ 
        // Initialize current, previous and 
        // next pointers 
        Node* current = head; 
        Node *prev = NULL, *next = NULL; 
  
        while (current != NULL) { 
            // Store next 
            next = current->next; 
  
            // Reverse current node's pointer 
            current->next = prev; 
  
            // Move pointers one position ahead. 
            prev = current; 
            current = next; 
        } 
        head = prev; 
    } 

    // Recursive Method
    Node* reverse(Node* head){ 
        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) 
            return head; 
  
        /* reverse the rest list and put  
          the first element at the end */
        Node* rest = reverse(head->next); 
        head->next->next = head; 
  
        /* tricky step -- see the diagram */
        head->next = NULL; 
  
        /* fix the head pointer */
        return rest; 
    }
